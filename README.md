# BF528-Projects
This repository contains various bash, Python, and R scripts I created to complete projects for my Translational Bioinformatics class.

For each project, I was assigned a different role with the task of reproducing a portion of the results from provided research papers. These roles and papers are detailed below:


## Project 1
Role: Biologist

Task: Connect the processed data into meaningful biological interpretation

Paper: Marisa et al. Gene Expression Classification of Colon Cancer into Molecular Subtypes: Characterization, Validation, and Prognostic Value. PLoS Medicine, May 2013. PMID: 23700391



## Project 2
Role: Data Curator

Task: Idenify, download, and describe relevant datasets and literature

Paper: O’Meara et al. Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration. Circ Res. Feb 2015. PMID: 25477501



## Project 3
Role: Programmer

Task: Write code to transform the downloaded data into an interpretable form

Paper: Wang, Charles, Binsheng Gong, Pierre R. Bushel, Jean Thierry-Mieg, Danielle Thierry-Mieg, Joshua Xu, Hong Fang, et al. 2014. “A comprehensive study design reveals treatment- and transcript abundance–dependent concordance between RNA-seq and microarray data” Nature Biotechnology 32 (9): 926–32. PMID: 4243706


## Project 4
Role: Analyst

Task: Examine and visualize processed data to aid in interpretation

Paper: Baron, Maayan, Adrian Veres, Samuel L. Wolock, Aubrey L. Faust, Renaud Gaujoux, Amedeo Vetere, Jennifer Hyoje Ryu, et al. 2016. “A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-Cell Population Structure.” Cell Systems 3 (4): 346–60.e4. PMID: 27667365


## Individual Project
For my individual project, I was able to revisit Project 2 and also perform the Analyst and Biologist tasks.
